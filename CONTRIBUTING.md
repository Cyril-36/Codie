# Contributing to Codie

We love your input! We want to make contributing to Codie as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

### We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)

All code changes happen through pull requests. Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation
4. Ensure the test suite passes
5. Make sure your code lints
6. Issue that pull request!

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.12+
- Node.js 20+
- pnpm 8+
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Git

### Local Development Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-org/codie.git
   cd codie
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   make install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**
   ```bash
   cp config/environments/env.example config/environments/.env.development
   # Edit the .env.development file with your local settings
   ```

4. **Start development environment**
   ```bash
   make dev
   ```

5. **Verify installation**
   - Backend: http://localhost:8000

### Project Structure

Please familiarize yourself with our [Project Structure](PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md) before contributing.

## Contribution Guidelines

### Code Style

#### Python (Backend)
- We use [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/) for code formatting
- [isort](https://pycqa.github.io/isort/) for import sorting
- [Ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) for linting
- [MyPy](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/) for type checking
- Line length: 88 characters

#### TypeScript/JavaScript (Frontend)
- We use [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) for code formatting
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for linting
- Follow [React best practices](https://react.dev/learn)
- Line length: 80 characters

#### Running Code Quality Checks

```bash
# Run all quality checks
make lint

# Fix auto-fixable issues
make format

# Type checking
make type-check
```

### Testing

#### Backend Testing
```bash
# Run all backend tests
make test-backend

# Run specific test
cd src/backend && pytest tests/test_specific.py

# Run with coverage
make test-backend-coverage
```

#### Frontend Testing
```bash
# Run all frontend tests
make test-frontend

# Run unit tests
cd src/frontend && pnpm test:unit

# Run E2E tests
cd src/frontend && pnpm test:e2e

# Run accessibility tests
cd src/frontend && pnpm test:accessibility
```

### Documentation

- Update documentation for any new features or API changes
- Use clear, concise language
- Include code examples where appropriate
- Update API documentation in `/docs/api/`

### Commit Message Guidelines

We follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

#### Types
- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only changes
- `style`: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code
- `refactor`: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `perf`: A code change that improves performance
- `test`: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- `chore`: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools

#### Examples
```
feat(api): add user authentication endpoint
fix(frontend): resolve navigation bar styling issue
docs(readme): update installation instructions
test(backend): add unit tests for user service
```

## Pull Request Process

1. **Update the documentation** if you're changing functionality
2. **Add tests** for new features or bug fixes
3. **Ensure all tests pass** and code quality checks pass
4. **Update the changelog** if your change is user-facing
5. **Request review** from maintainers
6. **Address feedback** promptly and professionally
