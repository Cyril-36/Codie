# Codie — Product Vision and PRD Overview

Codie is an AI-first code quality platform that unifies static analysis, runtime testing, security enrichment, adaptive style learning, conversational review, and confidence-based filtering in one explainable developer workflow.

## Goals
- Reduce alert noise by ~40% without missing critical issues
- Ship explainable suggestions via “Ask Why” with diffs and one-click “Apply Fix”
- Integrate runtime performance/regression checks directly into PR review
- Automate targeted unit test generation and safe rollout behind flags
- Provide ROI-based refactor recommendations using hotspots + complexity

## Core Differentiators
1. Repository-wide call graph & hotspot mapping
2. Dynamic runtime performance checker (containerized)
3. Chat-first reviews with diff previews and apply-fix
4. Style-adaptive suggestions (NATURALIZE-like)
5. AI-powered unit test generation (Diffblue for Java; GPT for JS/Python)
6. Intelligent refactor planner (ROI ranking)
7. CVE-linked security scanning with remediation snippets
8. Noise filter with confidence scoring and user override

## Success Metrics
- Analysis Accuracy: ≥90% detection rate; false positives ≤5%
- Runtime: 100% test execution success in containers
- Response Time: ≤15s typical PR analysis (≤100k LOC)
- Adoption: ≥70% chat usage; ≥60% apply-fix rate
- Coverage Uplift: ≥80% module-level coverage improvement (where tests are generated)

## Out-of-Scope (MVP)
- Full IDE plugin suite
- Custom rule DSL
- Air-gapped self-hosted mode (future)

## Phased Plan (Condensed)
- Phase 1: Infra + call graph/hotspots + complexity + runtime baseline
- Phase 2: Chat-first review + diff overlay + adaptive style + confidence scoring
- Phase 3: Test generation + coverage workflows + refactor planner
- Phase 4: Security enrichment + final noise filtering + launch hardening
